\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
High-\/level \doxylink{class_fight}{Fight} control class used to prepare and execute fights. 

The \doxylink{class_fight}{Fight} class orchestrates pre-\/fight preparation (setting menus, spells and objects), runs a provided \doxylink{class_fight_strategy}{Fight\+Strategy} implementation and performs post-\/fight actions (healing, sitting, etc.). It owns the currently active strategy via a unique\+\_\+ptr so strategies can be swapped at runtime.
